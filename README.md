# Game Of Life

Test task.
Technical requirments:

Minimal Requirement 
⦁	Implement a 10X10 board 
⦁	Start with random numbers of live cells 
⦁	Auto iterate through generation, with a 0.5-second delay between each iteration 
 
Advanced feature: 
⦁	Add a feature that let the user choose the number of cells
⦁	Add a feature to choose the number of living cells at the starting point   
⦁	Add a feature to let the user choose the delay between generations (the evolving speed): 
⦁	Add the ability to have other rules:  
⦁	Conway: The original rules 
⦁	Hyper Active: 
⦁	Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, Any live cell with more than five live neighbors dies 
⦁	Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell 
⦁	Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives, Any dead cell with non three live neighbors stays dead 
⦁	High Life: 
⦁	Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies 
⦁	Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell 
⦁	Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives, Any dead cell with non three live neighbors stays dead 
⦁	Spontaneous: 
⦁	The same as the original Conway rules with a tweak that a dead cell has a chance of 0.5 percent to be spontaneously reborn 
⦁	Add stable state detection: detect if the game reached a stable state and restart the game
